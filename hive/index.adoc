== Hive Data Source

Spark SQL supports relational entities (tables, functions, etc.) managed by Apache Hive using *Hive data source*.

You can enable Hive-related features using link:../spark-sql-SparkSession-Builder.adoc#enableHiveSupport[Builder.enableHiveSupport] while building a link:../spark-sql-SparkSession.adoc[SparkSession] (that in turn sets link:../spark-sql-StaticSQLConf.adoc#spark.sql.catalogImplementation[spark.sql.catalogImplementation] internal configuration property to `hive` when required Hive classes are available).

When `SparkSession` is requested for a link:spark-sql-SparkSession.adoc#sessionState[SessionState] that...FIXME

* link:configuration-properties.adoc[Configuration Properties]
