`PruneFileSourcePartitions` is...FIXME

=== [[apply]] Executing Rule -- `apply` Method

[source, scala]
----
apply(
  plan: LogicalPlan): LogicalPlan
----

NOTE: `apply` is part of the <<spark-sql-catalyst-Rule.adoc#apply, Rule Contract>> to execute (apply) a rule on a link:spark-sql-catalyst-TreeNode.adoc[TreeNode] (e.g. link:spark-sql-LogicalPlan.adoc[LogicalPlan]).

`apply` link:spark-sql-PhysicalOperation.adoc#unapply[destructures the input logical plan] into a tuple of projection and filter expressions together with a leaf logical operator.

`apply` transforms link:spark-sql-LogicalPlan-LogicalRelation.adoc[LogicalRelations] with a link:spark-sql-BaseRelation-HadoopFsRelation.adoc[HadoopFsRelation] and a link:CatalogFileIndex.adoc[CatalogFileIndex] (i.e. for Hive tables) when there are filter expressions defined and the Hive table is partitioned.

`apply`...FIXME
